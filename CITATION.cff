abstract: >-
  Here we present a novel Matlab-based spike detection
  algorithm, Adaptive-SWTTEO, inspired by an existing method
  that has demonstrated superior performance compared to
  other approaches. The new algorithmâ€™s performance was
  evaluated against the original method using a custom
  synthetic dataset that included both non-bursting and
  bursting neural activity. Results showed that the
  Adaptive-SWTTEO outperformed the original algorithm in
  terms of detection efficiency, reliability and speed.
